# Overview information

TODO(paulberry): I'm experimenting with calling the inference in method bodies
and initializer expressions "body inference". Get feedback on this.

Body inference is specified as a transformation from the syntactic artifacts
that constitute method bodies and initializer expressions (expressions,
statements, patterns, and collection elements) to coresponding artifacts in the
compiled output (referred to as "compilation artifacts"). The precise form of
compilation artifacts is not dictated by the specification; instead they are
specified in terms of their runtime behavior.

TODO(paulberry): maybe talk about how when we specify compilation artifacts in
terms of their runtime behavior, we gloss over exception semantics.

TODO(paulberry): maybe talk about the fact that errors are specified in this
doc, and that if at least one error is detected, the only normative behavior is
that compilation aborts; the precise details of error recovery and error
reporting are outside the scope of the specification.

TODO(paulberry): maybe talk about why it's important to specify type inference
as a series of procedural steps because of the state implicitly tracked by flow
analysis.

# Expressions

Type inference of an expression always takes place with respect to a type schema
known as the expression's "context". TODO(paulberry): examples?

Type inference of an expression produces a compilation artifact and a static
type.

TODO(paulberry): explain how it's not necessary for the static type of an
expression to conform to its context.

## Null

Type inference of a null literal (`null`), in context `K`, produces a
compilation artifact `m` with static type `Null`, whose runtime behavior is to
evaluate to the _null object_.

## Numbers

Type inference of an integer literal `l`, in context `K`, proceeds as follows:

- Let `i` be the numeric value of `l`.

- If the type `double` is assignable to `K`, and the type `int` is _not_
  assignable to `K`, then: (TODO(paulberry): assignability is only well defined
  between types; `K` is a type _schema_) (TODO(paulberry): the analyzer accounts
  for strong mode when performing these assignability checks; what is the effect
  of this?)

  - The result of type inference is a compilation artifact `m` with static type
    `double`, whose runtime behavior is to evaluate to an instance of `double`
    representing the value `i`.

  - If `i` cannot be represented _precisely_ by an instance of `double`, then it
    is a compile-time error. TODO(paulberry): does the analyzer actually
    implement this behavior?

- Otherwise, if `l` is a hexadecimal integer literal, 2<sup>63</sup> â‰¤ `i` <
  2<sup>64</sup>, and the `int` class is represented as signed 64-bit two's
  complement integers:

  - The result of type inference is a compilation artifact `m` with static type
    `int`, whose runtime behavior is to evaluate to an instance of `int`
    representing the value `i` - 2<sup>64</sup>. TODO(paulberry): does the CFE
    actually implement this behavior?

- Otherwise:

  - The result of type inference is a compilation artifact `m` with static type
    `int`, whose runtime behavior is to evaluate to an instance of `int`
    representing the value `i`.

  - If `i` cannot be represented _precisely_ by an instance of `int`, then it is
    a compile-time error. TODO(paulberry): does the analyzer actually implement
    this behavior?

TODO(paulberry): the CFE's `InferenceVisitorImpl.visitIntLiteral` method doesn't
implement int-to-double logic. What's up with that?

TODO(paulberry): non-normative notes about numeric literals preceded by unary
minus.

## Booleans

Type inference of a boolean literal (`true` or `false`), in context `K`,
produces a compilation artifact `m` with static type `bool`, whose runtime
behavior is to evaluate to the object _true_ or _false_ (as appropriate).

## Strings

Type inference of a string literal `s`, in context `K`, proceeds as follows:

- For each _stringInterpolation_ `s_i` inside `s`, in source order:

  - If `s_i` takes the form '`${`' `e` '`}`', then let `m_i` be the result of
    performing type inference on `e`, in context `_`.

  - If `s_i` takes the form '`$e`', where `e` is either `this` or an identifier
    that doesn't begin with `$`, then let `m_i` be the result of performing type
    inference on `e`, in context `_`.

- The result of type inference is a compilation artifact `m` with static type
  `String`, whose runtime behavior is to execute the compilation artifacts `m_i`
  (in source order), and then to concatenate the resulting strings together
  (along with any non-interpolation characters in `s`) to produce an instance of
  `String`.

## Symbol literal

Type inference of a symbol literal, in context `K`, produces a compilation
artifact `m` with static type `Symbol`, whose runtime behavior is to evaluate to
an appropriate instance of `Symbol`.
